Continuum is a mobile application that is used to capture and share photos and videos based on geographical location in a new and unique way. 

When a user takes a photo (or video) with their smart phone, that photo is then stored in the Continuum database. Other users of Continuum can view and comment on the photo. But the unique part is that photos are only available when a user is at the specific location that the picture was taken at. 

A user can be notified if they are at a location where a friend that they are following has taken a picture at some time in the past. The unique and intriguing aspect of this, is that while other mediums for sharing photos often results in pictures from several years ago becoming lost or forgotten - while a user is at that same location, having access to a picture that a close friend had taken there several years ago gains new significance.

Users have the option to post their photos publicly for anyone to see as a way of leaving their mark at any location. This adds another unique feature, which is to be able to scroll through pictures at a location based on the time they were taken. A user will be able to be at a popular location, such as some sort of landmark, and access a photo that was taken at some point in time and scroll back or forth through time based on the pictures that were taken at that location.

Lastly, users will have access to a realtime feed of pictures being taken near the location they are currently at. This is a interesting feature when considering events that are taking place. Users will be able to gain a view from multiple angles and perspectives, perhaps becoming aware of something significant that otherwise they may have missed.
